The Persistence of Stereotyping in Weber's Comparative Method

Max Weber's philosophical and sociological project is to answer why capitalism only develops in the Occident. In contrast to Marx, whose solution to the question is a systematic analysis of productive forces and relations as the driving force of historical change, Weber focuses on the so-called "superstructure" of a society, i.e. its ethos, spirit, etc. Specifically, Weber claims that the Protestant Ethic gives rise to a mentality conducive to the development of institutionalized capitalism, and he argues for the centrality of the Protestant Ethic in the progress of capitalism by comparing other religions of the world to ascetic Protestantism. While Weber denounces Marx's reductionist approach to interpreting historical progress as "naïve historical materialism"(_The Protestant Ethic _55), and indeed qualifies his thesis contending that "we have no intention of defending any such foolishly doctrinaire thesis as that the 'capitalist spirit,' let alone capitalism itself, _could only_ arise as a result of certain influences of the Reformation. (_The Protestant Ethic, _91)" I would argue that Weber's methodology of cross-cultural comparison is predicated on a premise that is no less deterministic in nature, i.e. the Protestant Ethic is the sufficient cause for the development of capitalism. In addition, because of Weber's exclusive focus on the influence of the spiritual/religious aspect of a society on its economic development (which is necessarily hierarchic) and his ultimate concern with Europe, his treatment of Chinese cultural traditions and practices is inevitably value-laden, however objective he purports his intention to be. Ultimately, Weber's method of answering how capitalism developed is not "scientific" in the modern sense of the word but rather anecdotal and tinted with a European mindset that has been inherited from the first European encounters with Asia. By fixating on only one aspect of a culture, Weber ignores the contingent factors that interact with this aspect in producing historical trends.

For Weber, the prerequisites for the development of capitalism are the separation of business from household, i.e. free labor; a high level of scientific capability and a systematic, formal and predictable administrative and legal system. Calvinism as a theistic religion unintentionally sanctifies a mentality that promotes attributes conducive to the progression of these prerequisites, whereas Confucianism does not. Calvinism's salient feature is predestination, which "engendered, _for each individual_ (Italics his)_,_ a tremendous inner loneliness (_The Protestant Ethic 104_)" because no one can be sure whether s/he is a member of the elect. This loneliness fosters a kind of individualism and distrust of even close family members, which as we shall see, is in stark contrast to the influence of Confucianism on individuals' behavior. Therefore Calvinism shatters the traditional familial ties, replacing them with self-interest, the ultimate goal of which is to convince oneself and others that one is worthy of God's grace. The intense worldly activity that results from this self-interest is the individual's calling. Accordingly each profession is put on an equal footing in which individuals strive to achieve the highest possible attainment to prove their worth. The result is free labor detached from familial connections.

Confucianism, however, emphasizes the "gentleman ideal," a man "who is both inwardly and in relation to society harmonically attuned and poised in all social situations. (_The Religion of China_ 156)" Weber argues that Confucianism does not have a prophetic element that turns its gaze towards the other-worldly; the Confucian gentleman adapts to rather than changes the world. This contentment with the status quo precludes the dissolution of the traditional ties, which in turn hinders the emergence of capitalistic enterprises. In addition, the ideal Confucian gentleman is well rounded and specification would be regarded as philistine. The significance placed on a thorough education in the classics and the nuances of social interactions ties back to Confucianism's this-worldly outlook: only those well-versed in the intricacies of practical undertakings have the best chance of being in harmony with the world. To sum up, ascetic Protestantism promotes individualism and Confucianism communalism, the former a pre-requisite for the development of a large-scale Capitalist economy, the latter a hindrance.

Since magic is no longer tolerated in ascetic Protestantism, the disenchantment that ensues forces Europeans to rationalize the world scientifically. Whereas in China, magic is still performed when spirits are invoked or sacrifices made. Science in China is therefore utterly pragmatic, i.e. science is useful only insofar as it solves everyday problems; science itself is not pursued as a means to rationally comprehend the world. For Weber, the stagnation of scientific innovation in China and the flourishing of science in Europe can be explained with non-material factors. The ethos precedes the material in shaping the course of Capitalist development.

A systematic administrative system develops in Europe but not in China for similar reasons. The radical individualism in European Protestant states facilitates rational organization of labor in a competitive setting, resulting in an impersonal, highly effective bureaucracy that further stimulates economic rationalization. Eventually Weber somberly announces the present age to be one where one is forced into an ossified mechanism that has been bureaucratized to encompass almost every aspect of one's life. What has its foundation in individualism ultimately metamorphosed into an "iron cage" that constrains it. Conversely, the social fabric that ties the Confucian state of China together is kinship and a scale of other relationships of descending importance. A formal system of administration and law enforcement is consequently unlikely. These circumstances, according to Weber, are unfavorable to the development of capitalism.

Throughout his analysis of the effects of religion on a people's actions, Weber assumes that the idea or ideal of religion is equivalent to the actual practices of the people commonly associated with it. Weber does not take into account the possibility of a discrepancy between belief and action, nor does he, by isolating religion as the key factor, investigate the interplay between other forces that may shape the course of a society's economic development. In other words, for Weber, people are "carriers" or "bearers" of the religious spirit, which is reminiscent of the Hegelian Geist that shapes world history through people. By comparing the "national character" of various Puritan states versus China, Weber echoes the Hegelian philosophy of history where the beliefs of a people determine its respective historical ascendency. In this sense, Weber does not differ significantly from Hegel in his deterministic approach. Weber's claim that "the question of the relative value of the cultures which are compared here will not receive a single word (xli)" is self-defeating as the implicit assumption in his sociological project is that a comparison of a single variable across two cultures, i.e. religion, will yield a meaningful result that is definitely value-laden: why capitalism develops _only_ in the Occident. Asserting the uniqueness of an institution presupposes a complacent attitude that would skew an otherwise objective analysis.

Interestingly, for Weber, China is still historically static, a stereotype that testifies to a Eurocentric value judgment. Weber acknowledges that "the sociologist essentially depends upon the literature of the missionaries. (_The Religion of China_, 231)" The characterization of the Chinese as a people that is suave, polite, unwilling to change, etc. still persists, even though Weber cloaks the repetition of these stereotypes into a purportedly objective analysis of Confucianism. Moreover, the relation of China to the West remains unchanged throughout the European intellectual tradition we have so far studied. Be it Leibniz, Hegel, Marx or Weber, each one is interested in China because they need an answer to a European intellectual problem. Even if their philosophical schemas could have universal applicability, the European mindset that engendered these schemas does not have a universal, dispassionate outlook. Europe underwent a great deal of changes during the time span that these four thinkers wrote. It would be easier for them to make comparisons if the frame of reference (in this instance, China) stands still; comparing two moving objects requires a theory of relativity that would unnecessarily complicate the point they want to prove.

Weber's sociology of religion is an invaluable attempt to utilize the process of science to explain social phenomena. Unfortunately the world is not the sociologist's laboratory to conduct experiments in. Without a controlled experiment, Weber makes do with empirical examples that resemble an experiment conducted with a control group. The systemic errors involved are conspicuous: it would be next to impossible to insulate religion from the other social forces at play (the confounding variables) and the inductive reasoning process is applied to too small a sample size (only the major religions of the world) to generate a sufficiently meaningful result. The objective limitations of his investigation aside, Weber's own subjective judgment plays a crucial role in filtering out "uncooperative" details that he would probably regard as statistical noise from his analysis; furthermore, his subjectivity is inherited from a European philosophical current that is quite the opposite of objective. In the end, the forces that shape a society are probably harder to pin down than the forces in nature; social "science" might just be a misnomer, a misapplied extension of the scientific methodology.

In chasing the ghost of Marx, Weber himself creates one that continues to haunt modern day social science. Weber's comparative analysis of ascetic Protestantism and Confucianism in explaining why Capitalism only developed in the West is enticing but far from scientific; the stereotypical portrayal of China persists, this time masked by a veneer of scientific objectivity. The problem of comparison remains a challenge to anyone who wants to seriously investigate differences across cultures, religions or political entities. Nevertheless, the pendulum might have swung the other way nowadays. Cultural relativism, an approach that gets rid of universal standards, relegates each culture to its distinctive place, rendering comparison futile. But on the other hand, is not comparison a most ingrained human reaction when differences are present? How else can we measure growth, decline or stagnation? To some extent, a world without comparison is a world without progress.
