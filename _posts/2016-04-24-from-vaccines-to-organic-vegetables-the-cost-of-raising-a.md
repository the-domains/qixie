description: 'When Xiaomi received her measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) shot last month, her mother, Caroline Meng, a Beijing native, was relieved. The 20-month-old girl was originally scheduled to receive the shot two weeks earlier, but she had been coughing and sneezing the whole time, and doctors advised against vaccination until the little girl was perfectly healthy, since fever is a common reaction among children who receive the vaccine.'
