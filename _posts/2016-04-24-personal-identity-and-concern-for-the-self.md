Personal Identity and Concern for the Self

Most people would agree that psychological continuity is a necessary condition for personal identity. Through his two thought experiments on how exchanging bodies and expecting torture affect one's perception of personal identity, Bernard Williams aims to demonstrate that the criterion of bodily continuity is also a necessary condition. I will first present Williams' case and argue why I do not agree with him.

To summarize the second thought experiment, Williams presents a person A who is informed that he is to undergo a series of six procedures, after each of which he is to be tortured. The six operations involve changes of memory-impressions and personality traits. (I) "produces total amnesia;" (338) (II) "leads to certain changes in his character;" (338) (III) induces memory-beliefs of a fictitious kind; (IV) is the same as (III), except that "both the character traits and the 'memory' impressions are designed to be appropriate to another actual person, B." (338) (V) is the same as (IV), except that the said memories are directly taken from the brain of B, leaving B the same as before; the last step (VI) is the same as (V), except that a similar operation as (V) is conducted on B. According to Williams, fear on the part of A expecting the eventual torture is assumed throughout the six steps. But I do not think it is appropriate for A to be fearful beyond (IV) since the assumption is that once A ceases to be A he would no longer fear future pain. In other words, I think the line where A stops being A should be drawn between (III) and (IV). I shall explain why in the following paragraphs.

First it is important to address why some of us would assume A to experience fear in the second thought experiment but not the first and why his fear may very well be irrational, which affects what criterion we should employ to determine personal identity. When we compare the two thought experiments, the first one leads us to the conclusion that psychological continuity is sufficient for personal identity, while the second one leads to a different conclusion, that bodily continuity is also a necessary constituent of personal identity, otherwise the person A would not fear torture in the second experiment. One critical difference between the two scenarios is that in the second presentation the equivalent of B was only mentioned in the "somewhat incidental r√¥le of being the provenance of the impressions of the past" (338) which A will end up with. In other words, A is worried because he is concerned with his identity. The identity of A and the identity of B from the perspective of A are not of equal psychological weight. We are predisposed to assign more importance to our own identity than that of another, even if the latter is to supplant the former at a future date. From (I) to (III), A is fearful because he is afraid of both the mental changes that are going to happen to him and the subsequent torture. But the reason why he experiences fear from (IV) to (VI) is not because of his fear of torture since the subject of this pain is in no way A himself, but because of his fear of mental death, or the replacement of another identity with his own. A may not fear bodily pain, but he is very likely to feel apprehensive about the eventual whereabouts of his memories. Concern for the self and preservation of one's identity play a key role in prompting fear.

I will now explain why it is inappropriate for A to experience fear at all beginning with (IV). Let us first imagine the psychological states of A as he contemplates the changes that will happen to him in the sequence described by Williams. Up till (IV) A may have increasing trouble with retaining his former self, but there is no better alternative than a deranged A. One can indeed give the example of a patient who first suffers amnesia, then some damage to his brain area responsible for personality and character, and finally hallucination to the point of schizophrenia. But we would be reluctant to claim that the patient has lost his personal identity in that the existing identity is still unique to A, despite the dramatic changes.

However, beginning with (IV), a competing person, B, comes up to claim the personal identity of A. (VI) reaches the final stage of the transformations where A and B "exchange" their personal identities. One objection Williams raises against drawing the line between (III) and (IV) is, "If I can expect pain through a transformation which involves new 'memories'-impressions, it would seem a purely external fact, relative to that, that the 'memory'-impressions had a model." (339) But it is of human nature to identify with someone or something (which partially explains our fascination with reincarnation after death) and having a model for identification does make a difference on the "allocation" of personal identity. (IV) introduces an existing person whose experience is by no means fictitious. It would seem that the reason why some of us anticipate pain in this scenario is simply that we are not used to thinking on behalf of another person's identity, which exemplifies an instance of human instincts overtaking reason and logic. The flip side of our concern for the self is our indifference to the memory-impressions of others, which renders thoughts of another person's identity replacing our own more effortful than necessary.

Another objection would be that the "memories" in (IV) are only apparent memories, without the proper causal link to actual experience, while case (V) provides the causal link as such "the result is produced by putting the information into A from the brain of B, by a method which leaves the same as he was before."(338) While judgments of personal identity can be made from an objective observer, I think it is more useful to imaginatively project ourselves as A and consider what personal identity means for _him_ as I did above. By putting ourselves into A's head, it becomes clear that from A's perspective, the memories in (IV) and (V) feel the same way to _him_. The identification with B is already in place with (IV).

One other concern would be why the line shouldn't be drawn earlier in the process. One may argue that A does not even survive amnesia, in (I). If amnesia is defined as the loss of one's memories of previous experience, it is possible to conceive of a specially trained agent who has lost all his episodic memories due to some traumatic event but nonetheless retains all the skills he previously had, which made him easily identifiable as a person. But if this is the case, it would seem that even at the end of the six steps, A still has a uniqueness that compels the survival of his identity. It seems interesting to think about how implicit memories and semantic memories (e.g. motor skills) play into the problem of personal identity.

Furthermore, it would also be interesting to imagine A's responses to the two thought experiments if he were equally able to have concerns for his own personal identity as well as that of another person. I do not think he would experience fear provided that all the memory-impressions at stake were stored. It would be interesting to engage in a thought experiment about personal identity where every person can feel the pain and joy and experience the inner world of others equally well as he feels and experiences his own. To the extent that this is inconceivable, concern for the self still constitutes an important component of personal identity.
