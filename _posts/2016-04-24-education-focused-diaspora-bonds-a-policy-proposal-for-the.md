Education-Focused Diaspora Bonds: A Policy Proposal for the Philippines
to Hong Kong Migration Channel

**__**

**_Introduction_**

Filipino migration to Hong Kong took off in the 1970s as the booming economy in Hong Kong demanded for more domestic helpers. Meanwhile, a national policy instituted by the Filipino government encouraged greater labor outflow as a strategy to earn remittances back home and has since produced one of the largest emigration in the world. 

Despite Philippine's relatively developed national policy of sending migrants abroad and earning remittances, social and economic issues such as migrants' treatment in receiving countries, left-behind families and stagnant growth still plague the country. I will propose a policy of education-focused diaspora bond for the Philippines that could potentially improve the development of Philippine's home economy with a better-educated labor force, as well as strengthen communication between migrant parents and their children back home. 

**__**

**_Overview_**

International migration has been a conspicuous aspect of the Philippines. According to data provided by Docquier and Marfouk (2005), the total stock of Filipino migrants to OECD countries amounts to 1679606 in 2000, with 16.3% employed in the primary sector in the host country, 17.5% employed in the secondary sector, and 66.2% employed in the tertiary sector of the economy. Of the migrants employed in each sector, around 60% were female and 40% were male. The Commission on Filipino Overseas documents that as of December 2012, the total number of Filipinos abroad is 10489628, 47% of them were permanent and 40% were temporary workers. Specifically, there were 195128 Filipino workers in Hong Kong, 90.6% of whom were temporary workers, i.e. workers who were expected to return home after their contracts expired. 

Although China is the biggest emigration country in East Asia, when we look at relative numbers, the Philippines rank highest, with over 8 million people, or almost 25% of its total labor force employed abroad. (World Bank, 2011) This remarkable number of emigrants can partially be attributed to a national policy instituted in the 1970s, when President Ferdinand Marcos saw the oil-boom in the Middle-East as a chance to curb domestic unemployment by sending young men abroad to work. Over the years, Filipino migration to other parts of the world helped the domestic economy. Professions like nurses and domestic helpers define part of the Filipino national identity. 

Filipino migration to Hong Kong took off in the 1970's and 1980's when demand for domestic helpers increased with Hong Kong's rising economy. 

As mainland China opened up its economy, Hong Kong's labor-intensive sectors moved to the mainland while local high-profit sectors thrived. An increasing number of females are moblized to deal with the resulting labor shortage. As this became true for more households domestic helpers were needed to take care of babies. 

The high wages and support from the Filipino government drew hundreds of thousands of Filipino workers, mostly young and female, to work in Hong Kong. Those who migrate have a means to provide for families back home and to enjoy a secure lifestyle in a developed city.

Figure 1

Currently, there are around 140000 Filipinos living in Hong Kong, consituting its largest minority. Figure 1 above shows the change in the magnitude of new hires deployed to Hong Kong in the years from 1993 to 2010, broken down by gender. 

The total number of Filippinos residing in Hong Kong remained relatively stable throughout the 2000s, although representing an ever smaller proportion of total foreign workers in Hong kong as shown in Figure 2\.

Figure 2

Demographically, migrants are mainly young, female Filipinos working in domestic services and the entertainment industry. The overall sex ratio for Filipinos in Hong Kong is 63 men per 1000 women. For women in the 25-34 age range, the sex ratio is only 28\. Filipinos aged from 15 -- 44 accounts for 74% of the total number of Filipino migrants in Hong Kong. The median monthly salary for Filipino women is 3580 HK dollars while the median monthly salary for Filipino men is 9000 HK dollars as of 2011 (Census and Statistics Department of Hong Kong, 2011). 

Poor working condition and unfair treatment afflict Filipino migrants to Hong Kong, a majority of whom work as domestic helpers for Hong Kong residents. Recently, there have been an increasing number of published cases about the abuse of maids by employers. Hong Kong's live-in law fosters an environment that often has maids on call almost 24 hours of the day and subject to abuse. Agencies and employers even hold maid's travel documents to prevent them from leaving without permission. Furthermore, thousands of maids file complaints with the Hong Kong Labor Department that has gone relatively unheard. The consistent maid labor supply and unaffected employers by maid complaints has created a secondary-class consisting of all the female maids. (De Moustier, 2014) Meanwhile, the Philippine's government, though highly reliant on its migrant worker supply in Hong Kong, does little to aid workers, leaving it to NGOs to fight for migrant worker rights. 

Despite the efforts on both sides to facilitate labor migration between the two countries, Filipino workers face barriers such as neglect and discrimination from agencies and the government in Hong Kong. However, push factors such as stagnant home economy and political corruption combined with pull factors such as the large demand for workers in the service industry, better wages and a higher standard of living in Hong Kong continuously draws vast amounts of young Filipino workers to Hong Kong, believing that the benefits will outweigh the cost of migration.

**_Effects of Migration on the Philippines_**

The exodus of skilled labor from the Philippines to the rest of the world has mixed effects on Philippine's domestic economy. On the one hand, many young Filipinos working abroad are more qualified than their jobs require, a case of brain drain and brain waste. On the other hand, remittances sent back to the Philippines from working migrants serve an important financial purpose for family members and help develop the national economy. Aside from economic impacts, with the massive outflow of young, female Filipinos, many school-aged children left behind by their parent(s) are not emotionally anchored to a parental figure that can provide guidance and support. 

Remittances have been a crucial part of the Filipino economy. The Philippines is the world's fourth largest recipient of remittances, trailing only India, China and Mexico. (World Bank, 2011) The graph below shows the steady growth of total remittances from 2003 to 2010\. Notably, the amount of remittances did not decline during the financial crisis of 2008, with the possible implication that remittances serve as a form of insurance against adverse economic shocks. The annual average number of transactions a migrant makes from Hong Kong to the Philippines is 15 (Asian Development Bank, 2006), the study also finds that Filipinos remit most frequently among South East Asian migrant workers overseas and that migrants in Hong Kong remit more frequently regardless of country of origin than migrants in Japan, Malaysia and Singapore.

Figure 3

Since remittances are large relative to the size of Philippines' economy, they are a large contributor towards short-term macroeconomic shifts as well as long-term growth in the economy. Therefore how the receiving country uses remittances is an important factor to consider when looking at the Philippines' economy. A large portion of remittances is consumed through daily necessities, but remittances also reduce the hours of employment for house-hold members, increases the probability of family members attending school, and raises the chance of a family owning luxury items, such as a television or a vehicle. (Yang, 2004). 

The Philippines faces a severe care crisis as a significant portion of females choose to migrate abroad to support their families, leaving children vulnerable to emotional strain and behavioral problems. (Ehrenreich & Hochschild, 2003) For mothers, caring for other people's children while separated from her own is a painful experience. Likewise, the children of these migrants suffer when one or both of their parents leave them to work overseas. Some develop psychological problems and others may become socially maladjusted. Even as transnational families become a norm in the Philippines, data on the children left behind remain scanty. Nevertheless, research does suggest that the children of migrant mothers reported being lonely, angry, unloved, unfeeling, afraid, different from the other children, and worried compared to all groups of children, including non OFW children. (Reyes, 2012) There is still an urgent need for a national policy specifically targeted at young children and migrating parents that would harness the enormous amount of remittances to address the issue of left-behind children.

**_Effects of Migration on Hong Kong_**

With its low birthrate and ageing population, Hong Kong has entered the stage of consistent reliance on foreign immigrants to grow its economy. As a major gateway of trade between China and the rest of the world, Hong Kong's ties and slow immersion with the mainland will continue to increase migration flows between Hong Kong and China. In the realm of Hong Kong's changing political and economic landscape, Filipino domestic workers are confined to a second class. 

Hong Kong hopes to keep its workforce young by instituting policies that encourage labor migration from regions such as mainland China and South East Asia. In particular, Hong Kong has relaxed regulations on migration from mainland. The One Way Permit (OWP) scheme, introduced in colonial times to facilitate family reunification, has been an important immigration instrument. Despite maintaining a separate immigration system, the OWP permits increased from 75 new arrivals per day to 150 in 1995\. The OWP arrivals are a main source of population growth in Hong Kong. (Wong et al, 2008) According to Wong et al, labor migration to Hong Kong has been two-tiered, with the low skilled migrants coming from countries such as Philippines in Southeast Asia and the high-skilled coming from US and UK. The high skilled workers represent a very small percentage of total migrants in Hong Kong. 

As of 2010, the stock of immigrants in Hong Kong amounts to 2.74 million, accounting for 38.8% of the Hong Kong population (World Bank, 2011). 

Domestic helpers constitute the largest source of labor inflow, largely due to a policy in the 1980s that encouraged immigrants from Southeast Asia to work in Hong Kong to alleviate the double burden of having a job and housework on local women. Recruitment policies are restrictive: domestic helpers cannot remain in Hong Kong after the work contract expires, and they can only work for a specific employer and are prohibited from working in any other field. Citizenship status is virtually impossible for temporary workers under these rules. Hong Kong's stringent policy has come under attack in the past. 

The United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination suggested Hong Kong should consider amending or repealing this policy in 1997 (United Nations, 1997). But domestic helpers remain a marginalized and disenfranchised group in Hong Kong. 

Even though policy in Hong Kong demonstrates a healthy flow of Filipino immigrants in Hong Kong yearly, Hong Kong law confines these Filipinos to second-class citizenry. Whilst in Hong Kong, one must not only be employed, but also obey the three-employer maximum per domestic worker rule before having to return to the Philippines.(Siu, 2014) 

Live-in law also restricts maids to live in the employer household. As a result, on Sundays, Hong Kong's main financial district, Central, is immersed by a sea of Filipino maids publically sitting on pieces of cardboard boxes passing the time on their day off. The general attitude of Hong Kong's natives toward the large Filipino migrant population is largely one of indifference, because there is little to no competition within the job market between locals and natives, and the natives are accustomed to foreigners through the British occupation and the immigration of expatriates from all over the world to partake in Hong Kong's trade.

**_Policy Proposal_**

My policy will aim to utilize education-focused diaspora bonds to foster stronger relationships between Filipino migrant parents in Hong Kong and their children back home and to facilitate equal educational access to all children in the Philippines. 

Although the Philippines to Hong Kong migration channel is well established and economically beneficial to both sides, Philippines' dependence on remittances is ultimately unsustainable in the long run, as domestic helpers from the Philippines are gradually replaced by those from neighboring countries such as Indonesia. Figure 2 clearly shows the declining percentage of Filipino workers among all foreign-born workers in Hong Kong from 1996 to 2011, and the trend is most likely to continue. Currently, remittances account for roughly 10% of Philippine's GDP (World Bank, 2011) and are a crucial financial resource for many households. According to Trinh Nguyen of HSBC Hong Kong, calamities such as the 2004 Super Typhoon Haiyan highlights the dependence of Philippines on remittances as families turn to their migrating member for help in times of crisis. (Yap, 2013) It is not hard to imagine that with other countries supplying increasingly cheaper labor, the Philippines would have to rely less on remittances and more on a strong and diversified home economy.

To tackle the development problem, the Philippines government could issue diaspora bonds to migrants working in Hong Kong. While many things can be achieved with the money raised including building more clinics, bridges or other infrastructure, my policy focuses on using diaspora bonds on the development of better educational programs for all children. An incentive for migrant parents to adopt the program is provided: the government will provide free phone credits to overseas workers so that they wouldn't have to pay to call their children. 

The children are often an overlooked aspect when it comes to migration, but they are the human capital of the next generation. Economic development is impossible without better educational opportunities for these children. A compelling body of research shows that primary and secondary education are crucial to economic development and growth (Schweke, 2004) Forward thinking policy makers would do well to focus on the children of their country as primary contributors to future growth. This is especially relevant for the Philippines since migrating parents, many of them female, take the future prospects of their children very seriously. A diaspora bond issued specifically for the purpose of strengthening communication between parent and child as well as bringing about better educational resources for children is a good incentive for migrants to invest in it, which ultimately also helps the development of Philippine's home economy as future labor force participants are equipped with skills necessary to succeed.

The specific steps to implement this policy would be as follows:

1\. Issue the above-mentioned diaspora bonds with migrating parents (especially mothers in the case of Hong Kong) as targeted potential investors.

2\. To incentivize parents to invest, free phone credits will be provided to migrants so they can communicate more with their children.

3\. The money raised will be used to improve school facilities, offer financial aid to students in need and any other programs that give children a better education.

4\. Credit enhancement will be provided by multilateral agencies to counter the risk of potential poor governance.

5\. Banks such as Asian Development Bank will serve as a guarantor for the bond in case of default.

The only short term economic loss of this policy would be the government giving free phone credits to migrant parents. However, this temporary and small loss can be justified by the gain in both parents' and children's emotional well-being from more frequent contact. In _Global Woman, _Parrenas documents stories of Filipino children whose mothers are overseas working. A clear pattern that emerges from accounts of these children is that closer ties with parents are not only correlated with improved performance in school, but also emotional and psychological benefits. One example is Ellen, who graduated top of her class in both high school and college and is pursuing a degree in medical school. She credits "open communication" with her mother as a key to success. _(Ehrenreich & Hochschild, 2003): _"We communicate as often as we can, like twice or thrice a week through e-mails. Then she would call us every week. And it is very expensive, I know..." The word that jumps out from her statement is "expensive." It is not surprising that migrant parents may be reluctant to spend hard-earned money on strengthening family ties when it could be used on something with more tangible benefits, e.g. invest in their children's education, purchase daily necessities, etc. However, in the long run, the author concludes that open communication allays "many insecurities that arise from transnational household arrangements." _(Ehrenreich & Hochschild, 2003) _Policy makers who have these children in mind may want to provide free phone credits to migrant mothers and fathers as a reward for investing in diaspora bonds to make sure emotional bonds aren't severed due to physical distance.

Diaspora bonds are by no means a new invention and have been successful in many developing countries with heavy emigration. The rationale behind diaspora bonds is simple: migrants are patriotic, patient and knowledgeable about the situation at home. Diaspora bonds will be a precious opportunity for migrants to invest in their home economy. Money-raising is generally successful as long as the government has enough credibility and is not too corrupt. Israel and India are two countries that issue diaspora bonds. According to economists Suhas Ketkar and Dilip Ratha, together they have raised over US$44 billion using these bonds. (Ketkar & Ratha, 2010) Ratha offers a comparison of Israel and India's issuance of diaspora bonds in this table below:

Figure 4

Although similar programs that tap into migrants' wealth through diaspora bonds to fund local development exist, an education-focused diaspora bond has yet to be introduced. However, there is reason to believe that the issuance of this bond would be effective for the Philippines. The Philippines has launched a pilot project in 2011 to secure Diaspora Investment. Its mission is "the promotion of remittance savings and the use of these remittances in economic and social investments, from the micro-scale of home-busineses and short-term savings up to the large scale of remittance securitization by banks for big-ticket public-private partnership financing (i.e. development bonds, etc)." (Commission on Filipinos Overseas, 2011) With the large population of educated, skilled Philippines in Hong Kong and elsewhere around the world, the Philippines has a lot to gain from the trust and investment of its migrants. Data from the Development Bank of the Philippines indicate that the average daily balance for remittances alone reach in the 100 million pesos. Even a tiny fraction of that amount of money can be a huge help to children needing better education, a cause that many migrant parents believe in.

Many children in rural areas of Philippines currently have trouble securing the financial means for school. After Haiyan struck the country on 8 November 2013, 4.1 million people were displaced, including 1.7 million children. The devastation occurred in some of the poorest regions in Philippines where 40% of children were already living in poverty. (UNICEF, 2014) 

Due to Philippines' location on the typhoon belt, the country suffers from severe storms annually from July through October, and children's schooling is and will be affected by natural disasters like Haiyan. Meanwhile, national statistics indicate that only 78 out of 100 Grade 1 entrants have kindergarten experience. Among the 6 year olds, which is the official entry age to Grade 1, 14.5 per cent are not in school and 25 per cent are still in preschool. But research indicates that children who don't start school at the appropriate age are more likely to experience learning difficulties than their peers. (UNICIEF, 2014) Educational facilities in the Philippines are far from perfect. Poor children in provinces without elementary school "can be particularly at risk for nonattendance if transportation costs are too high." (Schelzig, 2005) Another subgroup, disabled students, also suffers from lack of school facilities as schools aren't properly equipped and teachers aren't well-trained to provide the education they need. The money raised from the education-focused diaspora bond could be used to provide pre-school education and transportation subsidies to more children; they could also be used to provide more facilities catering to disabled students -- one particularly ill-served group in the Philippines. 

This policy would also be effective in alleviating the emotional stress that left-behind children experience since free phone credits are offered to migrant parents to call their children back home. On the parents' side, they will likely invest in the bond since its mission is aligned with their interest and they also get the reward of being able to call their children more often. Children, in turn, will benefit from more educational resources if they know that they have their parents' consistent support. This positive feedback loop makes sure that children have access to both more educational opportunity and their parents' support. 

If migrant parents are still unwilling to invest due to concerns about the financial aspect of the diaspora bonds, financial experts can devise multiple levels of risk-return profiles and maturities to appeal to different investors. Typically, Filipino domestic helpers in Hong Kong sign a two-year contract, which is often renewed twice, and return upon expiration of that contract. Hardly any foreign domestic helper can eventually become a citizen of Hong Kong. A bond with a maturity of five to six years would probably attract more migrants in this case. In addition, this bond represents a rare opportunity for migrants who want to save and invest their money rather than send everything home. 

The effectiveness of the program is also predicated on governance and execution. To provide credit enhancement, independent asset management companies could be brought in to manage the fund once a significant size is reached. Other multilateral agencies or NGOs can provide consultation to the government on where to spend the money. Migrants' concern that government corruption may get in the way of successful implementation of this policy can be assuaged by a transparent disclosure of how the money is managed and where it is spent. The Asian Development Bank, located in Manila, can be a guarantor of the bond to assuage concerns of default.

Ideally, all parties involved benefit from the education-focused diaspora bond:

* Migrant parents (investors) will be able to communicate more with their children through the phone credit rewards.

* Children of migrants will benefit from more open communication with their parents.

* All children will benefit from more educational resources funded by the diaspora bonds.

* The Filipino government will benefit because this is a great opportunity to demonstrate government responsibility and accountability to the people.

* The Philippines as a whole will benefit from more human capital in the form of well-educated and highly-skilled students.

**_Conclusion_**

The Philippines sends hundreds of thousands of workers to work abroad each year and receives remittances that account for 10% of its GDP. An education-focused diaspora bond would not only provide the 3-6 million left-behind children in the Philippines more opportunity to communicate with their parents but also more access for all children to quality education. As an incentive to invest in the diaspora bond, free phone credits will be provided to migrants so that they can communicate more with their children back home. This policy will deliver benefits to all parties involved albeit a small short-term cost for the government (to provide free credits). The Philippines has been dependent on emigration and remittances for decades now; it is important to develop a strong and diversified domestic economy that is self-sustained and sustainable. The issuance of this diaspora bond will raise money that can be used to give more children a better education and a brighter future. In the long run, the Philippines will benefit from the productivity, insight and innovation of highly-educated individuals. This policy could be a first step to transform a migrant-dependent economy to a self-sustaining one.
